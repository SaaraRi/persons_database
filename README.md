# Person Database, cards display

**This project fetches user profile data from an external source  
and displays each user on a card on the web page**

- The 'fetch' API with chaining and asynchronous function (async/await)  
  are used to make a HTTP server request to access remotely stored person objects.  
  Appropriate error handling is used and fetched data converted from JSON.

- A card is added on the web page for each fetched person/user  
  showing their name, username and email (using the classList object).

- Each person's fetched user id is used to generate a cat image  
  from a hashing web service and displayed on the person's card.

- The application's design and functionality work on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
